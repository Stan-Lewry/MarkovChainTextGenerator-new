Mac laptops (both) can only access certain, seemingly random files in PC share (but not others in same folder) even with admin accounts and the entire drive shared to "everyone" with full control. I cleared and re-set permissions for the documents folder to ensure it wasn't in an "inconsistent state" with some files missing permissions, but it did not fix the problem.
Mac Pro will not allow any user to access its own documents folder, even locally logged on users.
Mac Laptops appears to display old versions / cached copies of files when connected to the Mac Pro (customer insists date stamps for certain files are not current)
Mac Laptops cannot access shares on the mac desktop, even with read/write permissions for "everyone" set.
Mac Pro (desktop) cannot access windows PC share at all, even with the same credentials used on the laptops it gives invalid password errors.
Mac laptops can see each other and work together fine.
Mac Pro will sometimes connect to the Macbooks and be fine, but at random it refuses to work at all until file explorer windows (finder) are closed and reopened? (permission error)
All machines are set to use the same workgroup, and can see each other.
Customer does not want us to come out until we have a "for sure" solution as they have to leave work to be there for us.
Customer refuses to bring PC in to shop and insists on an on-site fix (granted, in-shop work would surely prove ineffective for this problem)
If all else fails, customer wants "at least" all the macs to interopeate properly without the pc.
Customer wants us to be there friday if possible at a specific time that they will decide.

hey.
Whats the matter?
not much..What about you?
Im fine hun. How you been?
i've been fine. tri has seen better days
Why is that? Im confused alittle.
well, I'm ending Tri and Sig's chapter for good this time. I have had multiple people ask me if they are ok because they saw/heard about sig and irisi being together.
Alright, thats fine, as much as I wasn't being with her as they may have said. I will give you back the caneen, I don't desreve it.
your talking like we aren't going to be friends still
I feel like a shit head at the moment, Ashley.
why couldn't you just talk to me about it before it got this bad
To be honest I wanted too, but I am not good at these talk. And then when I did see you I wanted to be with you, so I forgot about it for the time being. Ashley, I am sorry, I am a total douche and I can understand if you don't want to be my friend for this.
I just wish you would of told me to spare Tri's feelings. I will still be your friend, but expect tri to be distant for awhile.
And I yours, and I will wait for Tri, I wont bother unless Tri wants to talk, hun, I guess I will leave you be for the night.
i'm not mad irl just rather annoyed. I don't know how many times i've asked you to talk to me when something is bugging you or whatever and it never happens. I always had to pry it out of you. I guess it was doomed from the start cause of that.
I just never wanted to put my feelings on you, is all, Ashley, always been like that since a kid. I rarely open up to my own mother, and she does a lot for me. Im sorry if how I act in irl comes into the game.
it shouldn't...if you were unhappy with Tri you should of just said so. it's a game its supposed to be fun not your char becoming so miserable with mine that you have to stray. It hurt tri badly to be told that her fiance prefers to be with someone else over her.
not to mention tri and irisi were starting to become friends
I see.. I just dunno anymore.
about what?
Just this game, I really don't.
its only what you make it  hun. thats why i'm changing some things up
I know, dear, but since Daisy rarely gets on, and Semmy doesn't like getting on much, I might just stop getting on as well.
they have irl stuff going on too though
Well, yes and no.
Daisy claims she works a lot, and she did in the past when she was on a lot and now, she little by little is giving up the game.
Semmy is tired of the drama, which I can't blame here.
her.
i didn't know there was other drama. I only focus on whats going on with tri
Dream drama, like people trolling, yelling, other dream wars, things like that. :P
when i'm here i get rid of all that for them
Well, its a long thing with another dream, and a person.
Gayley.
She wanted to be sister dreams with us, and well the shit hit the fan, so to speak.
ah i see
So it was a war of the dreams, guardians were invovled, the whole nine yards.
So thats kinda the reason we don't see Daisy on anymore.
i always miss the good stuff
Not really.
Bunch of bullshit if you ask me.
I would have rather worked in a dump, then have dealt with it.
sounds like it.
Mhm.
i would take a break after that too
Yea, it was a mess.
atleast its over now
I hope so. It was stressful.

I never thought I'd be one to post a retirement thread because I always hated these things, always sad reading them and never fun seeing someone go but here I am writing this...
I wanted to apologize because I've been a pretty bad role model as a supermod, taking jokes too far, making fun of members too much, insulting other mods, jokingly or not, I've gone too far and nobody's been keeping me in check as a super.
It's gotten pretty hard to tell when you guys take a stab at me, if it's a joke or not, I'm sorry that's happened.
Just today I couldn't hold a conversation with other moderators with out them making fun of me, in all honesty Im not insulted, more saddened because of what I've caused and I hope it's not too late to change the direction I've set some staff in.
The other day, I was blabbering in the shoutbox and got into a small argument with LADY and I was blaming my assholeness for my lack of sleep, she told me I had to change because Im a moderator and of course, we're looked up to by other members and people base their actions off of how we act and what we do. Then I realized it wasn't because I didn't get enough sleep that I was being mean, it was because I'm the problem in itself.
This isn't a sappy goodbye thread but more of me trying to change something before it's too late, in the end with out our members,  the annoying ones, the good ones, the Rockys, the NGTs, the TornadoCreators, all of them and once mods like myself started poking fun at a few of them the line got blurry and deteriorated into a flame war, between mods and mods, and mods and members.
As for myself, appropriately nobody takes me serious due to my almost always joking attitude, majority of the time rude and cold remarks.
Me and MBO used to poke fun at eaechother, Id call him stupid and hed make fun of me because I pretty much had no life, it was in much more elaborate manners of course but eventually we couldn't tell if we were serious about the jokes or not, our jokes went too far and the attitude between MBO and I was just negative and that's pretty much what I turned the staff into.
Even as I was writing this, I was told some mods were assholes and should be replaced and Im sorry for being that shitty role model.
It's not too late to turn this around because me and MBO are a living testimony, we're good friends now and still talk every so often.
I want you guys to make sure your jokes are actual good spirited jokes and not just insults because the line between the two is blurred and lots of members have the idea that we're a bunch of assholes, which we're not and you guys are more than capable of proving them wrong.
I've outstayed my time as mod and should say goodbye, I haven't done much moderating, not much anything, strange thing is this is the first thread Ive posted in over 3 months.
I still love NGU and want to stay friends with you guys but sometimes if you love something, you have to say goodbye.

Somewhere
The flames of greed lick the innocent’s skin
Twisted whispers corrupting the thoughts within
Tugging stronger and stronger toward a path to sin
The road down self-destruction starts when the first life ends
Somewhere
A defiler sits idly with a casual smile
Obscuring the ideas festering so vile
With the patience of a saint he instigated his guile
Weaving the chains of distrust and deceit
A healthy warm hue reflects off her face
As the raging inferno consumes her heart
A reflection of the flames burning her parents alive
The thoughts that ran through her mind
As she watched her parents scream and die
Are enough to chill you so cold you freeze where you stand
As she watched the fires burn
She contemplated with a straight face
She was justified in doing this
For their making her believe in a God that died
And somewhere
That defiler drinks with a perverted grin on his face
Unfeeling for the murder he just indirectly instigated
“All for the good,” he shouts to the crowd
“More ignorance has been killed before me now.”
And somewhere
As the Earth becomes a killing field for faith
The guilty wipe their hands clean
“No blood on my hands,” the murderers chant
How many deaths have been in the name of a Godless future?

Dee, hi! I just wanted to say congratulations on your transition. I think its fantastic that you are expressing your authentic self! That takes a lot of courage! I wanted to share with you that i myself am going through my own gender exploration. I’m still figuring myself out. At first i thought i might be trans, now i think i might be more non binary. I really don’t like to use all the terms and labels. I think that our society over complicates things. People are who they are. I think its

Sequencing and scheduling is a form of decision-making that plays a crucial role in manufacturing and service industries.
Scheduling is a decision-making process that is used on a regular basis in many manufacturing and services industries.
The resources may be machines in a workshop, runways at an airport, crews at a construction site, processing units in a computing environment, and so on.
Scheduling, as a decision-making process, plays an important role in most manufacturing and production systems as well as in most information processing environments. The following examples illustrate the role of scheduling in a number of real world environments.
Gate Assignments at an Airport Consider an airline terminal at a major airport.
The gates are not all identical and neither are the planes.
Some of the gates are in locations with a lot of space where large planes (widebodies) can be accommodated easily.
Other gates are in locations where it is difficult to bring in the planes; certain planes may actually have to be towed to their gates.
If boarding is postponed, a plane may remain at a gate for an extended period of time, thus preventing other planes from using that gate.
The scheduler has to assign planes to gates in such a way that the assignment is physically feasible while optimizing a number of objectives.
This implies that the scheduler has to assign planes to suitable gates that are available at the respective arrival times.
In this scenario the gates are the resources and the handling and servicing of the planes are the tasks.
Scheduling Tasks in a Central Processing Unit (CPU).
One of the functions of a multi-tasking computer operating system is to schedule the time that the CPU devotes to the different programs that have to be executed.
Scheduling can be difficult from a technical as well as from an implementation point of view. The difficulties on the implementation side are of a completely different kind. They may depend on the accuracy of the model used for the analysis of the actual scheduling problem and on the reliability of the input data that are needed.
The Scheduling Function in an Enterprise.
The scheduling function in a production system or service organization must interact with many other functions.The software controlling such an elaborate information system is typically referred to as an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system.
Scheduling is often done interactively via a decision support system that is installed on a personal computer or workstation linked to the ERP system.
Terminals at key locations connected to the ERP system can give departments throughout the enterprise access to all current scheduling information.
These departments, in turn, can provide the scheduling system with up-to-date information concerning the statuses of jobs and machines.
There are, of course, still environments where the communication between the scheduling function and other decision making entities occurs in meetings or through memos.
In a manufacturing environment, the scheduling function has to interact with other decision making functions.
In a manufacturing environment, the scheduling function has to interact with other decision making functions. One popular system that is widely used is the Material Requirements Planning (MRP) system. The MRP system keeps track of the inventory of each part.
In doing so, it uses techniques such as lot sizing and lot scheduling that are similar to those used in scheduling systems.
There are many commercial MRP software packages available and, as a result, there are many manufacturing facilities with MRP systems.
In the cases where the facility does not have a scheduling system, the MRP system may be used for production planning purposes.
However, in complex settings it is not easy for an MRP system to do the detailed scheduling satisfactorily.

ADV PU doesn't have that many Psychic-Types to play around with, but those who've thought they've found a metagame where Unown is usable can keep on searching. Unown is outclassed by Smoochum and Natu offensively and Drowzee defensively. With a barren movepool and horrendous base stats, Unown hits as hard as a wet noodle and falls at the drop a hat. Overall, Unown is a side-splitting, laugh out loud, no seriously who got fired for conceiving this, sorry excuse for a Pokemon. Maybe the opponent will feel sorry for you using it and just forfeit.
